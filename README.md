```bash
npx prisma init
```

This will create a new `prisma/` folder with a `schema.prisma` file inside, and also add a `.env` file at the root of your project.

If you haven't installed Prisma yet, first install it with:

```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

And if you also want the Prisma Client to query your database:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```


docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

## üåü About the Project

This is a **IntelliLab** designed to help developers practice coding challenges in multiple programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java). The platform includes features such as:

- **Dynamic Code Editor**: Powered by Monaco Editor, allowing users to write and test code in real-time.
- **Problem Descriptions**: Detailed problem descriptions, examples, constraints, and hints.
- **Test Cases**: Predefined test cases for each problem to validate solutions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Write solutions in JavaScript, Python, or Java.
- **Submission Tracking**: View submission history, memory usage, runtime, and status (Accepted, Wrong Answer, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern UI/UX principles for a seamless experience on all devices.
